# BetaDemoApp
Demo apps for sdk beta release

## Classifier demo: 
The classifier model is adapted from the tensorflow for poet2 example. The model recognizes 1001 classes of objects. In the demo, the classes with the highest probabilities are displayed on top of the camera view. Timing information for every step in our processing chain from image source to the final label is displayed below the camera view.

We are adding demos for object detection and face detection soon. Feel free to email us and suggest the demos you would like to see!
